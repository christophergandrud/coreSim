# Version 0.2

- `b_sim` has been incorporated into qi_builder so that the simulated
coefficients and QI calculations can be accomplished in one function call.

- Handles categorical variables entered as `newdata` either in their
original format or matching the coefficient name output.

- Can find polynomially transformed terms if entered in the model fit function
with there base term + the `I` function. Note, currently only supports up to
`x^9`.

- Can find natural logarithmically transfromed terms if entered in the model
fit function with the `log` function.

- Added `original_order` to `qi_builder`. If `TRUE` then the values are returned
in the original simulation order. Only relevant if `slim = TRUE`.


# Version 0.1

- Minimal working version.
