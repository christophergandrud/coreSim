> Core functionality for simulating quantities of interest from generalised linear 
models.

## Purpose

Using simulations to find quantities of interest and associated uncertainty
can be an effective way of showing substantively meaningful results from 
generalised linear models (GLM). 

This R package provides core functions that can serve as the back bone to other
packages for finding and plotting simulated quantities of interest from GLMs.

##Â Steps

1. Estimate your model using whatever GLM model fitting function you like 
(note: I've only tested `lm`, `glm`, and `survival`).

2. Simulate coefficients with `b_sim`.

3. Find your quantities of intest with `qi_builder`.

4. Present your results, e.g. with by plotting the simulated quantities of 
interest.

## Examples: Normal linear model 

Here is an example using data from the **car** package:

```{r}
library(coreSim)
library(car)

# Normal linear model
m1 <- lm(prestige ~ education + type, data = Prestige)
# Simulate coefficients
m1_sims <- b_sim(m1)

# Create fitted values
fitted_df_1 <- expand.grid(education = 6:16, typewc = 1)

# Find predicted outcomes
linear_qi <- qi_builder(b_sims = m1_sims, newdata = fitted_df_1)

head(linear_qi)
```
